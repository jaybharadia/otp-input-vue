# Ground Rules
### Expectations for behavior 

 Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist:
> https://github.com/novaday-co/otp-input-vue#key-features
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Vue Community Code of Conduct](https://vuejs.org/about/coc.html).


# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Package? You can start by looking through these [Key features](https://github.com/novaday-co/otp-input-vue#key-features) and help-wanted issues:
 Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
 Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.




# Getting started
### a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project we use [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
    * Send a pull request.
